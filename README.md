or

## Customization

### Personal Information

Edit the data files in the `src/data` directory:

- `profile.js` - Personal details, experience, education, skills, and projects
- `blogs.js` - Blog posts content

### Styling

- Global styles are in `src/App.css`
- Component-specific styles are in their respective CSS files
- Color scheme can be modified by changing the CSS variables

### Adding New Blog Posts

Add new entries to the `blogs` array in `src/data/blogs.js`:
javascript
{
id: 2, // Increment this for each new post
title: "Your Blog Title",
date: "YYYY-MM-DD",
summary: "A brief summary of your blog post...",
content: "Full content of your blog post...",
tags: ["Tag1", "Tag2", "Tag3"]
}

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

### First-time setup

1. Install the GitHub Pages package as a dev dependency:
```bash
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
# or
yarn add --dev gh-pages
```

2. Update the `package.json` file:
   - Add your GitHub Pages URL as the homepage: 
     ```
     "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/portfolio-blog"
     ```
   - Add deployment scripts:
     ```
     "predeploy": "npm run build",
     "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
     ```

3. Configure React Router for GitHub Pages by updating `src/App.js`:
   - Use `HashRouter` instead of `BrowserRouter` or set the `basename` prop:
     ```jsx
     <Router basename="/portfolio-blog">
     ```

### Deployment

Run the deploy command:
```bash
npm run deploy
# or
yarn deploy
```

This will build your app and publish it to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository.

### GitHub Repository Settings

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to Settings > Pages
3. Ensure the source is set to the `gh-pages` branch
4. Your site will be published at `https://yourusername.github.io/portfolio-blog`
